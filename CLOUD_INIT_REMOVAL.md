# Cloud-Init Removal Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to remove all cloud-init related code from the Hyperlight VM Agents project. The VM agent is now directly baked into the VM image for faster boot times and simpler deployment.

## Files Removed

1. **`cloud-init-vm-agent.yaml`** - Complete cloud-init configuration file that was used to provision VMs with the shell-based VM agent
2. **`vm-agent.sh`** - Legacy shell-based VM agent script (replaced by Rust binary)
3. **`vm-agent.service`** - Systemd service file for the shell-based VM agent

## Files Modified

### `host/src/host_functions/vm_functions.rs`
- **Removed**: `create_cloud_init_image()` function (161 lines)
- **Updated**: Comment in `create_vm_image()` to reflect baked-in agent approach
- **Fixed**: Import cleanup and process handling for cross-platform compatibility

### `README.md`
- **Removed**: References to "Cloud-init based VM provisioning"
- **Updated**: VM provisioning description to "Direct VM agent deployment (baked into VM image)"
- **Updated**: Setup instructions to focus on `./build-minimal-vm.sh` instead of cloud image downloads

### `setup-vm-environment.sh`
- **Removed**: Ubuntu cloud image download logic
- **Removed**: ISO creation tools (genisoimage/xorriso)
- **Added**: Rust toolchain installation and musl target setup
- **Added**: busybox-static installation for minimal VM images
- **Updated**: Setup instructions to emphasize minimal VM image building

### `build-minimal-vm.sh`
- **Updated**: Boot time comparison comment (removed "Ubuntu Cloud-init: ~30-60s" reference)

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Cloud-Init Based)
```
Host → Creates cloud-init ISO → QEMU boots with ISO → Cloud-init provisions VM → Downloads and installs shell VM agent
Boot time: ~30-60 seconds
```

### After (Baked-In Agent)
```
Host → Uses pre-built minimal image with Rust VM agent → QEMU boots directly → VM agent starts immediately
Boot time: ~1-2 seconds
```

## Benefits of Removal

1. **Faster Boot Times**: Reduced from 30-60s to 1-2s
2. **Simpler Deployment**: No cloud-init dependencies or ISO creation
3. **Better Performance**: Statically-linked Rust binary vs shell script
4. **Reduced Dependencies**: No need for genisoimage, cloud-init, or Ubuntu cloud images
5. **More Reliable**: Eliminates cloud-init initialization failures
6. **Smaller Image Size**: Minimal rootfs instead of full Ubuntu cloud image

## Technical Details

### VM Agent Implementation
- **Language**: Rust (was shell script)
- **Binary**: Statically linked with musl for maximum compatibility
- **Location**: Embedded in minimal rootfs at `/usr/bin/vm-agent`
- **Startup**: Automatic via init script, starts immediately on boot
- **Communication**: VSOCK to host on ports 1234 (registration) and 1235 (commands)

### Minimal VM Image Components
- **Kernel**: `vmlinux` (minimal Linux kernel with VSOCK support)
- **Rootfs**: `rootfs-template.ext4` (64MB ext4 with busybox + VM agent)
- **Agent**: Rust binary with async VSOCK communication
- **Init**: Custom init script that mounts filesystems and starts VM agent

### Boot Process
1. QEMU loads kernel and rootfs directly (no bootloader needed)
2. Kernel starts with VM ID and CID from command line parameters
3. Init script mounts essential filesystems
4. VM agent binary starts and connects to host via VSOCK
5. Ready to receive commands in ~1-2 seconds

## Migration Guide

### For Developers
- Use `./build-minimal-vm.sh` instead of downloading cloud images
- VM creation now uses minimal images automatically
- No changes needed to VM command execution API
- Faster development cycle with quicker VM boot times

### For Deployment
- Ensure Rust toolchain is available for building VM images
- Install busybox-static for minimal rootfs utilities
- Remove cloud-init related dependencies from deployment scripts
- Update monitoring to expect faster VM startup times

## Future Considerations

- Consider Firecracker support for even faster boot times (~125ms)
- Potential for VM image customization through build-time parameters
- Opportunity to add more development tools to minimal image
- Possibility of creating specialized images for different use cases
